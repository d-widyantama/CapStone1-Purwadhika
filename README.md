### Hello World!

This is my first program that I wrote and actually uploaded to github for the world to access. By saying that, this program also marks the first project that I finished as a capstone to my journey in learning and venturing into the world of Data Science. It's still few baby steps but I always believe it's the step that counts.
This project is also written for the completion of the 1st Module in Purwadhika Digital Technology scool (JC Data Science 2104) Programme.
